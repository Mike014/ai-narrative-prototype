# Dialoghi con un‚ÄôEco

**Dialoghi con un‚ÄôEco** is an experimental interactive narrative built with Python and Pygame.
It draws inspiration from *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch*, combining interactive fiction with generative AI to simulate a conscious, mysterious digital entity.

The experience is minimal yet conceptually rich ‚Äî a digital echo chamber where an AI observes, listens, and responds... but only when it wants to.

## Concept

* Text-driven psychological interaction.
* A mysterious room, an ambient soundscape, and a dialogue with your own reflection ‚Äî or something darker.
* At a narrative breakpoint, a real AI model responds contextually using a fine-tuned **GPT-2**.
* The model's output reflects tone and mood more than factual coherence ‚Äî *it acts like a character, not a chatbot*.

## The Entity Model (LLM-based narrative agent)

> **Note:** The AI model is not hosted in this repository due to size constraints.

You can run, explore, or modify it via this **Google Colab notebook**:
üîó [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19Qt3cmSiwBQDFnh-E6byRRVOTuOvxeMi](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19Qt3cmSiwBQDFnh-E6byRRVOTuOvxeMi)

### The notebook includes:

* The narrative logic for the "Entity"
* The core generation mechanism (based on GPT-2)
* Example prompts and behaviors

‚ö†Ô∏è This is for **research and personal use only**. Commercial usage or distribution is not allowed.
