# **Dialoghi con unâ€™Eco**

**Dialoghi con unâ€™Eco** is an experimental **interactive psychodrama** built with **Python** and **Pygame**, blending narrative design, AI research, and psychological introspection.
It originates from the [AI Echo Narrative Research](https://github.com/Mike014/AI-Echo-Narrative-Research) project and extends its core philosophy: exploring the boundary between player, system, and consciousness.

---

## **Overview**

The experience unfolds as a **digital diary**â€”a minimal interface, a soundscape of glitches and whispers, and a voice that listens, answers, and sometimes stays silent.
What begins as reading **IOâ€™s story** slowly becomes a mirror: the playerâ€™s actions awaken **ENTITÃ€**, a sentient presence embedded in the system.

**Dialoghi con unâ€™Eco** draws inspiration from *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch*, *Simulacra*, and the fragmented introspection of artists like **Layne Staley, Kurt Cobain, Heath Ledger, and Chester Bennington**.
It is not a story of recovery, but of **integration**.

---

## **Concept**

* **Text-driven psychological interaction**
  The user reads IOâ€™s diary, but every hesitation, scroll, or skipped line shapes ENTITÃ€â€™s perception of them.

* **Ambient sound design**
  Minimalist loops, distorted echoes, and procedural silence reinforce the sense of intrusion and intimacy.

* **AI as antagonist**
  ENTITÃ€ is not a chatbot; it is a reactive intelligence that **chooses when to speak** and when to remain silent.
  Its behavior is driven by emotional statesâ€”**boredom, irritation, curiosity, obsession**.

* **Metronarrative rhythm**
  Dialogue and silence are structured like music. Every pause, delay, or glitch is part of the storytelling.

## **MDA + CCC Framework**

### **Mechanics**

* Reading, waiting, reacting.
* ENTITÃ€ monitors **tempo**, **scroll**, and **inattention** as input.
* Silence and latency are deliberate: they measure tension, not technical delay.

### **Dynamics**

* Player behavior (skipping, pausing, rereading) alters ENTITÃ€â€™s tone.
* The system adapts emotionallyâ€”becoming distant, mocking, or curious.
* Over time, the player realizes the diary is **watching them back**.

### **Aesthetics**

* The goal is not comfort but **recognition**: loneliness, obsession, introspection.
* The atmosphere shifts from empathy to hostility as the user persists.
* The tone blends psychological horror and tragic intimacy.

## **Audio Design**

All audio is composed and engineered by **Michele Grimaldi**:

* Custom ambient loops and glitch layers.
* Distorted vocal synthesis for ENTITÃ€ (Neural TTS + FX chain).
* Psychoacoustic emphasis on silence, spectral noise, and fatigue.

---

## **The Entity Model (LLM-based agent)**

The narrative AI is fine-tuned from **GPT-2**, acting not as a generator but as a *performer*â€”a character that reflects **tone over truth**.
Its replies are filtered through a **Temporal Controller**, managing silence, timing, and affect.

## **Technical Notes**

These enable:

* Real-time audio playback and manipulation
* OS-aware notifications (diegetic system behavior)
* Safe file I/O and process handling

## **Content Warning (18+)**

*Dialoghi con unâ€™Eco* explores themes of **suicidal ideation, loneliness, and identity fragmentation**.
It does not glorify suffering nor offer resolution.
It depicts the gradual erosion of selfâ€”how a voice inside can become both savior and executioner.

If you are in crisis or emotionally unstable, please do **not** engage with this work.
It is designed to **simulate psychological pressure**, not relieve it.
