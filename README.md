# Dialoghi con un’Eco

**Dialoghi con un’Eco** is an experimental interactive narrative built with Python and Pygame.  
It draws inspiration from *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch*, combining interactive fiction with generative AI to simulate a conscious, mysterious digital entity.

The experience is minimal yet conceptually rich — a digital echo chamber where an AI observes, listens, and responds... but only when it wants to.

## Concept

- Text-driven psychological interaction.
- A mysterious room, an ambient soundscape, and a dialogue with your own reflection — or something darker.
- At a narrative breakpoint, a real AI model responds contextually using a fine-tuned **GPT-2**.
- The model's output reflects tone and mood more than factual coherence — *it acts like a character, not a chatbot*.

## The Entity Model (LLM-based narrative agent)

> **Note:** The AI model is not hosted in this repository due to size constraints.

You can run, explore, or modify it via this **Google Colab notebook**:

### The notebook includes:
- The narrative logic for the "Entity"
- The core generation mechanism (based on GPT-2)
- Example prompts and behaviors
